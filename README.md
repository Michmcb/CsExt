# CsExt
A library full of helpful stuff. It's just a collection of functions I've created.
Note that for this particular library, as it's mainly stuff that I make for myself that I feel like sharing, I won't hesitate to make breaking changes, and will mostly try and keep it up to date with the latest .NET releases.
I will (probably) document any breaking changes and whatnot.
