    <PackageReleaseNotes>- UtcDateTime uses the same Ticks as DateTime now (as it should have always been doing).
- DateOnly extensions for getting year/month/day.
- Useful constants moved to a static class DotNetTime, as well as UnixTime conversions.
- Tz type added, for use as a Timezone which can never be outside of the range +14:00 to -14:00. Can be converted from TimeSpan.
- Iso8601Format does all the string formatting now, and can format strings with however many decimal places as desired.
- IsoYearWeek can accept a DateTime and DateOnly as well, for ease of use. It also checks to make sure year/month/day are legal values.
- ErrState added, to hold an error message as well as an additional state object.</PackageReleaseNotes>
