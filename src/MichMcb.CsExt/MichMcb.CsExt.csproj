    <Description>A library full of helpful stuff. It's just a collection of functions I've created. Note that for this particular library, as it's mainly stuff that I make for myself that I feel like sharing, I won't hesitate to make breaking changes, and will keep it up to date with the latest .NET releases.</Description>

    <PackageReleaseNotes>UtcDateTime.TryParseIso8601String Improvements...
- Fixed bug where it did not parse strings with leading/trailing whitespace correctly as the documentation says it does
- Corrected the error messages when it could not parse a string
- T and Z are case insensitive as per ISO-8601
- Decimal for milliseconds is allowed to be . or , as per ISO-8601
- Removed ability to specify custom separators bewteen date/time, as it isn't ISO-8601 complaint and can't be parsed anyways. Instead if the - or : are problematic, use basic format which does not have any separators.
- String formatting methods have changed. There's one for UTC and one for TimeZone, with bools rather than taking a format. ToIso8601String takes a format, and TryToIso8601String has been added as well
- DateUtil.GetLengthRequired and DateUtil.ValidateAsFormat replaced with TryGetLengthRequired, which does both at once

Maybe&lt;TVal, TErr&gt;
- Maybe now has static methods to construct an instance, where TVal and TErr are the same type</PackageReleaseNotes>
